# Blog Writing Skill

Write polished, publish-ready blog posts in Kritano's brand voice. Accepts a topic or prompt and outputs a complete `.md` file.

## Input

The user's prompt: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### 1. Read the user's prompt
Identify:
- The core topic or question to answer
- Any specific angle, audience, or goal mentioned
- Whether a post type was specified (how-to, listicle, thought leadership, etc.)

### 2. Select the post type
Based on the prompt, choose the best structure from `blog-structure-templates.md`:
- **How-to** — step-by-step guides, tutorials, practical walkthroughs
- **Thought leadership** — opinion pieces, industry takes, forward-looking analysis
- **Listicle** — numbered lists of tips, tools, mistakes, examples
- **Comparison** — X vs Y, pros/cons, honest assessments
- **Case study narrative** — story-driven posts around a real project or result
- **Explainer** — breaking down a concept, technology, or trend for non-technical readers

If unclear, default to **how-to** or **explainer** — these match the brand voice best.

### 3. Apply tone of voice
Read and follow `tone-of-voice.md` (sourced from the brand voice analysis). Key principles:
- Conversational, relatable, like explaining to a smart friend
- First person singular ("I") for editorial content
- British English spelling throughout (optimise, colour, favour)
- Open with a relatable question or shared experience
- Explain technical terms in plain English immediately after using them
- Be honest about trade-offs — never purely promotional
- Use contractions naturally
- Name specific tools and technologies
- Em dashes for asides and personality

### 4. Apply audience persona
Reference `audience-personas.md` to shape complexity, framing, and examples.

### 5. Write the draft
Using the selected structure template:
1. Write the hook/opening
2. Build out each section following the template
3. Weave in practical examples, named tools, and honest opinions
4. Close with a personal recommendation and soft CTA

### 6. Apply SEO guidelines
Reference `seo-guidelines.md`:
- Ensure heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2/H3 nesting)
- Front-load the target keyword in the title and first paragraph
- Include the keyword naturally 3-5 times
- Write a compelling meta description (150-160 chars)
- Add internal linking suggestions where relevant

### 7. Reference examples
Check `examples.md` to ensure the output matches the quality bar and style of existing published content for the chosen post type.

### 8. Apply frontmatter
Add YAML frontmatter following `frontmatter-schema.md`.

### 9. Generate featured image
After writing the blog post, generate a featured image using the `/draw` skill:

1. Use the **wide** format (1920×1080, 16:9)
2. Generate **1 variation** (not the default 3)
3. The image should be typographic and atmospheric — display the post title, category label, and Kritano branding
4. Use the post's category to influence the colour accent (e.g. indigo for SEO, emerald for Accessibility, red for Security, sky for Performance, amber for Content)
5. Save to `/docs/draw/blog-<slug>/1.html` and convert to PNG
6. Reference the PNG path in the output so it can be uploaded as the post's featured image

The draw prompt should be: `wide 1 variation — Blog featured image for "<post title>" in the <category> category`

### 10. Publish to Notion
After writing the `.md` file, publish it to Notion by running:

```bash
.claude/skills/blog/publish-to-notion.sh /path/to/blog-post.md
```

This creates a page under the Blogs parent page in Notion with the full post content, metadata callout, and proper formatting.

### 11. Output
Output a single `.md` file with:
- Correct YAML frontmatter
- The full blog post
- Suggested meta description in the frontmatter
- Any notes on internal linking opportunities (as an HTML comment at the bottom)
- The path to the generated featured image PNG
- Confirmation that the post was published to Notion (with link)
